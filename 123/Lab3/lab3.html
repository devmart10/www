		<h3>Lab 3 - Warm/Cool Color Scene</h3>
		<hr>
		<div>
			<canvas data-processing-sources="Lab3a.pde"></canvas>
			<i>Warm colors with darker warm colors in the back</i>
			<p>
				<b>Description:</b> These images represent the different uses of warm and cool colors as well as their light
				and dark counterparts, and the different effects that can be achieved with different combinations.
				This image is my favorite because it looks like an abstract Mars.
				If you would like to see the code I used to create this picture, follow the link.
